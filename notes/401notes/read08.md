## Rule of Three

1. I don't have any specific times when I went back and refactored but I definitely think back to it now and I could have done quite a few things differently.
   I'll probably go back and fix it at some point for my portfolio.
2. I would have to find a way to refactor the written code by abstracting it into functions or classes that can be called or imported in the case of react.

## You aren't gonna need it & MVP benefits and pitfalls.

1. Potential Benefits
   - Early feedback: With an MVP, you can get feedback from users early and use it to guide future development.
   - Reducing risk: By releasing a product early, you can verify whether the product is viable and see how the market responds before investing more resources into it.
   - Faster time to market: An MVP allows you to get your product in front of users faster than if you waited until it was fully featured.

2. Potential pitfalls
   - Wasted resources: If you spend a lot of time and resources building features that users don't need or want, you could end up wasting a lot of effort.
   - Missed market opportunities: While you're waiting to release your product, competitors may seize the opportunity to capture your target market.
   - Lack of user feedback: If you wait until the product is fully mature to release it, you miss out on valuable user feedback that could help you improve the product.
