## RecyclerView

1. What makes a RecyclerView dynamic?
-   Efficient display of data by only creating the elements when they're need based on the supplied data and how it should look.
-   It recycles the individual elements so when an items scrolls off the screen, the item isn't destroyed, instead it reuses it for new items that have scrolled onto the screen. This improves performance and responsiveness while reducing battery consumption.
-   Provides flexible layouts such as linear lists, staggered or regular grids. This is handled by layout managers that take care of the arrangement of individual items.

-   I haven't finished the lab yet so I can't put a screenshot in.

-   ### Would you like to know more?

-   My understanding of this is super abstract at this point. I'll have to use android studio a bit more before it clicks.
