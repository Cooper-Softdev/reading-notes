## Primitives vs. Objects

Explain the difference between an “int” and an “Integer” in Java.
- int is a data type whereas Integer is an object. Specifically a wrapper class in the java.lang package.
What is the default value for ints? Integers?
int default value is 0, Integer default is 'null'
What is autoboxing? Unboxing?
- This allows Java to enable automatic conversion between the data type and it's wrapper class.

1. List the three basic categories of exceptions.
    1. Checked Exceptions
    2. Unchecked Exceptions
    3. Errors
What type of statement can you use to handle an exception?

- Logging items in a store or books in a library. SKU codes or ISBN numbers and titles, authors... all that jazz.

2. What is input from a Scanner broken down into?
- Scanner input is broken down into tokens. which is the smallest meaningful chunk of code. An integer or word string.
