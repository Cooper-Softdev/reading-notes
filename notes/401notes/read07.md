### Would you like to know more?

How do any of you remember exactly how to write something out without having docs and youtube open? I've been trying to do repetition and saying what the code is doing 
in my head as I'm typing it out to bake the syntax in, but I just can't seem to remember it very well. I know that doesn't mean I haven't learned it, but it makes
me feel like I haven't. feelsbadman.jpg
