## Java Imports

1. Use an analogy to explain Built-In packages. Give examples.
   - Built-in packages are like pre-made tools  that take care of a lot of boilerplate code that you may have to write over and over again. Like using a power drill instead of screwing something in by hand.

2. Explain the steps for creating a new package in IntelliJ.
    - Go into project view and select a directory.
    - Go into the context menu and select New -> Package.
      Type in the name of the new package.

3. Different types of loops in Java
    - For Loop & Enhanced For Loop
    - While and Do-While loop

4. Which loop types use a loop counter?
    - For Loop and Enhanced For Loop
    
5. Explain the difference between While and Do-While loops.
    - While Loops check if a condition is true, and runs a loop of that condition is true and stops when the condition is no longer true.
    - Do While Loops will run the code once, then check the condition afterwards, and if true will continue like a While Loop. Otherwise it will not run.

## Java Arrays

1. Describe 3 built-in methods for Arrays.
    - Array.sort(array): Sorts the array in ascending order.
    - Arrays.toString(array): Returns a string representation of the array.
    - Arrays.copyOf(array, length): Creates a copy of the array with a specified length.
  
2. How is the size of an array determined in Java?
    - It is determined when the programmer creates the array, much like delcaring the type before making a variable.

## Data Structures & Algorithms

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
    - One of the most important things to consider when deciding which data structure to use to solve a particular problem is the type of operations you'll be performing most frequently. For example, if you need to frequently access elements by index, an array or ArrayList would be suitable. If you need quick lookup by keys, a HashMap would be appropriate.
    
2. How can we ensure that we’ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
    - To avoid an infinite recursive call stack, you need to ensure that there's a base case that will be hit at some point, which stops the recursion.
  
## Engineering Reading

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
   - I mean gosh, I don't think many people have that ability. Maybe my particular blend of creativity and analytical thinking, ability to communicate complex concepts in a simple way, and a knack for problem-solving.
  
2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
  - Take breaks regularly when I get brain fried.
  - Rubber ducky debugging with my dog.
  - Break the problem down to smaller steps.
  - Ask GPT why questions, like why am I dumb? Why did I think this was a good idea?
