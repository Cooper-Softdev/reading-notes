## Java OO Tutorial

#### Object and Class

In Java, a class is a blueprint or template that describes the behavior/state that the objects of its type support. An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It has state and behavior. For example, a class could be "Car" and an object could be "myCar", a specific instance of Car.

#### Inheritance

Inheritance in Java is like how children inherit traits from their parents. In Java, a "child" class can inherit fields and methods from a "parent" class. For example, if we have a "Vehicle" class with properties like "speed" and "size", and methods like "accelerate" and "brake", a "Car" class could inherit all those properties and methods and add more specific ones, like "number of doors".

### Java Static Keyword

Static methods in Java are also called class methods because they belong to the class itself, not to any instance of the class. They can be called without creating an instance of the class. Similarly, static variables can be accessed directly using the class name, without creating an instance of the class.

### Java Singleton Class

A design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. It's like a template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. For example, the Singleton pattern is like a company having a single CEO. There is only one instance of the CEO class. A Singleton in Java is a class that restricts the instantiation of itself to a single instance.
