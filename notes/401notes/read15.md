## Trees

Imagine a family tree. The oldest ancestor is the root of the tree. This person's children are the root's direct nodes or branches. 
Each of these children may have their own children, who are nodes of their parent node.

Trees are useful for several reasons:

Hierarchy: Just like a family tree, trees in computer science represent hierarchical relationships between objects.

Organized Data: Trees keep data organized. They provide a structure to hold sortable data, making search operations efficient.

Efficient Operations: Operations like insertion, deletion, and searching can be very efficient on a tree.

The file system in most operating systems use a tree system, as well as the HTML DOM.
