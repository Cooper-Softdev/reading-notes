## What Is AWS Amplify

**The link didn't go into specifics on Netlify or Firebase so I asked Bard**

  - **Firebase**:
     + Differences: Firebase is a BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service) that offers capabilities like a realtime database, authentication,
    cloud functions, hosting, and more. It provides an integrated experience and is especially popular for mobile application development.
    + Tradeoffs: Firebase is super user-friendly, but its pricing can become complex as you scale. Unlike AWS, where you have access 
    to a vast number of additional services, Firebase is more limited.

  - **Netlify**:
    + Differences: Netlify is primarily a CI/CD and hosting solution for static sites, but it's expanding to offer serverless functions, identity/authentication, and other features. It's known for its "git-centric" workflow where changes are deployed to production as soon as you push to a linked git repository.
    + Tradeoffs: Netlify offers an incredibly simple setup and great developer experience. However, for more complex backend requirements or integrations with other services, you might find it limiting.
