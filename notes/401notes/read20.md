## Android Fundamentals

1. What is an Intent in Android Studios? Give some fresh examples of when you might use it. 
-  An Intent is like a function call and a React Router combined. It can be used to load a new Activity, or to activate back-end functionality when certain parameters
  are met. Like if I wanted to order food on an app and I click Start Order, that might call the GPS part of the phone to activate and get my location so it can show
  the nearest restaurants near me when the next Activity loads up.

3. Describe an Activity in your own word.
-  An Activity can be thought of similarly to a React Component or separate HTML pages on a website. Each Activity is a separate function that accomplishes
  a singular task, sign-up activity, user profile view, main view.
