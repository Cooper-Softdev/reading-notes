# Personal Pitch

## Long Version 1

"Hello, I'm Cooper. I've spent the last few years working as an air traffic controller, a role that requires quick decision-making, 
attention to detail, and the ability to manage complex systems. I've always been fascinated by technology and its potential to solve 
problems, which led me to explore the field of software development and artificial intelligence.

What excites me most about AI is its ability to uncover patterns and relationships that might be too obscure or complex for humans to parse. 
I'm particularly interested in how this can be applied in fields like cybersecurity or social media, where vast amounts of data need to 
be analyzed quickly and accurately.

I've always been a quick learner and a problem solver. I graduated from the air traffic controller academy, which has an 80%+ failure rate, 
demonstrating my ability to grasp complex concepts quickly and perform under pressure.

In terms of my unique perspective, my experience as an air traffic controller has given me a deep understanding of the importance of 
user-friendly interfaces in high-stakes environments. I believe this perspective would be valuable in creating intuitive user experiences 
in the tech industry.

I'm currently looking to transition into a role where I can leverage my problem-solving skills and interest in AI. I'm open to a variety 
of roles and companies, but I'm particularly interested in opportunities that allow me to contribute to creating intuitive user interfaces 
and experiences. I'm excited to connect with others in the industry and explore potential opportunities."
