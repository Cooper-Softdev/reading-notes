## OAuth

OAuth can provide your application with a way to authenticate users without needing to handle or store their passwords. 
Instead, your application can delegate the authentication process to trusted services (like Google, Facebook, or GitHub), 
which will handle the user's credentials and provide your application with a token that represents the authenticated user. 
This token can then be used to perform actions on behalf of the user, such as accessing their data or performing actions 
in their name. This process can enhance the security of your application and improve the user experience, as users can log 
in using their existing accounts on these trusted services.
