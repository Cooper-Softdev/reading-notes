## Android Development

1. What is a technology youâ€™ve used before that is similar to Shared Preferences?
-  Local storage in a web browser from the JavaScript course I believe is similar to this.
    Except instead of being stored as JSON it's stored as a key value pair like a CSV Doc I think.

2. Why is testing important? Give at least 4 reasons, and explain which is the most important to you and why.
-   Ensures code is working properly and functions as intended.
-   From the links though, it improves code quality by leading to better design decisions therefore more maintanable code.
-   Testing makes it easier to refactor somehow.
-   Allows developers to make changes to the codebase, which is somehow different than refactoring, which allow regressions to be caught.

3. Create an analogy for Tasks and the back stack. Have we used a similar system before? Explain.
-  Tasks and the back stack are like a regular stack as opposed to a queue. New tasks go onto the stack, and when you go back it removes the
  top task and goes back to the previous. Also similar to hitting back arrow in a web browser or last song in a playlist. Like a linked list,
  but for tasks within the app?
