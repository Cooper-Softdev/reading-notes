# JavaScript function notes

## Summary 

- A function is a piece of code that will take the values (**arguments**) of multiple parameters and use those to create/**return** some sort of output. Operators are used to do arithmatic, or compare two or more values and even assign values to variables. The classic mathematical operators are included like +, -, /, or *, as well as assignment operator like =. Comparison operators are things like ==, !=, and < or >. 

## Q & A

1. In Javascript the Control Flow is the flow in which code it to be executed by the CPU. The standard control flow is top to bottom of the code file. With functions though, the control flow can (and usually is) changed from this default to many places within the file, and to other supporting files within the greater program.

2. A function is a piece of code that will take the values (**arguments**) of multiple parameters and use those to create/**return** some sort of output. 

3. A function invokation or call is what causes the function to execute the code that is contained within it. 

4. The paranthesis are there to contain the parameters or values that the function needs to use in order to execute it's code. If a function needs a certain user to be logged in, that parameter can contain the value of the user that is logged in, if it matches then the function can execute things to display that are specific to that user, as an example.
