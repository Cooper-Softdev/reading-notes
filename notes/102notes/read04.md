# HTML and Wireframing

## Note Entry

When making a website it seems the best approach is to draft an outline of what the website and it's pages should look like and what content should be displayed and other pages within the website to. This is in an effort to make the user's experience easy, not confusing, and engaging. Once a draft (called a wireframe) is done, then the developer should use HTML, CSS, and JS to create the website similar to what was drafted.
