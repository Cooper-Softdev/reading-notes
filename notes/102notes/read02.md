# Text Editor vs Code-specific editor vs IDE

## Note Entry

A regular text editor is just a place to put text into a document, which may be formatted in Markup syntax or almost
any other programming language. Features will be quite slim, they're meant to be lightweight and simple.

A coding specific editor is similar to a regular plaintext editor but it may offer features that make it easier to 
use for coding syntax. Examples are Syntax Highlighting of the language, maybe even a system to open multiple 
files and keep them all separated from each other, including being able to save them.

An IDE is a full enviroment with many of the tools in one place for even more aspects regarding coding. Things like debuggers
to highlight logic errors, a compiler to process your code and package it together. And a more robust file management system.
