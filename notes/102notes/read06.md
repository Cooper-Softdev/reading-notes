# JavaScript notes, please kill me

## Summary 

**JavaScript** is a coding language originally made for interacting with webpages. It has 3 major parts within it. JavaScript the language, JS the DOM API with is how the language interacts with the webpage inside the browser, and JS the API which is Node.js and a few other less common ones.

**Computers and how they work** playlist was neat, I didn't know that electricity within computers moved nearly the speed of light, I just assumed it was a fraction of it. I didn't fully understand circuits and logic, like logic gates and what not but hopefully I can brush up on that later. Programs are just programs ontop of other programs ontop of others, it's turtles all the way down!

## Q&A

1. A variable is a container for storing data, like a value "how many apples? apples = 5", it can be a number "int" or a "string" which may contain letters or numbers, but is not calculated as number unless specified.
2. To declare a variable is to give it a name or something identifiable. If a variable is a container for storing data, we must name that container something for reference, because the value inside of it may change.
3. The assignment operator = assigns an identifier to it's value. apples is the identifier, = is the assignment operator and 5 is the value.
4. information received from the user is prompt(). or something like that.
