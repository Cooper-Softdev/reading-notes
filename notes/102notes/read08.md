# Operators, Loops and Expressions

## Summary 

- Operators are symbols or keywords used to perform some basic mathematical operations on data values or variables. They can also include logical operations, and comparisons. Expressions are a combination of values, variables to produce a result or output. Some are simple like 1+1 which evaluates to 2, or complex like 'x > 10 && y < 20' which can be used to determine is something is true or false. Loops are a construct that allow you to repeat a piece of code repeatedly until a certain (user determined?) condition has been met, or is no longer being met.

## Q & A

1. An expression is a combination of values, variables and an operator to be evaluated to produce a result. They can be used to retrieve data, do logical operations or just represent a calculation.

2. We can use a loop to repeat code until a certain condition is met. If a user needs to type in a special phrase to get past an input box, we can continue asking the same question until the user gets it correct.

3. A for loop is a construct that allows you to execute a piece of code. A for loop should be used when the user knows in advance how many times the code should be executed, because it can execute infinitely otherwise.

4. A while loop will stop executing when the condition specified in the loops header evaluats to false. While true, the for loop will continue indefinitely until the condition is met, then stop.
