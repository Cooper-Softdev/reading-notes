# Reading 05: Images, Color, Text

#### Accessibility for users is important, this module goes over some things about that? It also touches on making things nicer to look at which is good too.

## Reading

### HTML Media

1. Screen readers can see that there is an image inside a webpage, but since the visually impaired cannot see it, the alt should describe what the image shows. Browsers will also default to the alt text if it has issues getting the packets for the image to display due to slow connection issues.

2. Image accessibility can be improved with alt text, or figure caption, using the appropriate image type, and having a backup image ready if one doesn't load for whatever reason.

3. If I'm making a website about animals, I could add an explanation describing in detail things about the animal like it's scientific name and what it's diet mainly consists of.

4. Alright old man, a GIF is an image format that magic boxes use to display images on that tv screen. A GIF is a computerized version of a "flip-book" comic like the one with that depressed cat that eats the ethnic food. It's small, and lightweight (usually) and when the sheets are played one after the other, it looks like one of them "movin' pictures you been watchin' inside that new theatre that bought out the old Woolworth Company warehouse. An SVG image is another type of image format but this time, instead of a grid with colors assigned to each grid square, you'll find that inside the SVG image file is just a whole heap of math! Leave it up to them brainiacs to make a simple image so darn complicated. The reason it's a whole Mrs. Dorothy's rhubarb pie worth of math is that them there smarty-pants wanted a way to make images way bigger, without making it look worse. So all them lines and angles in a regular image are calculated and then stored as a mathematical formula, so all the magic box has to do is some math to scale it up or down, like those model aeroplanes in the Sears catalogue you get hand mail delivered every month by the postman Mr. Evensen? You know, I hear he goes with Miss Mildred the elementary school teacha' now, heard through the grape vine, that last woman he had, Shirley, done ran off with a man and they're trying to make it big in Hollywood, California. Now ain't that sumthin'.

5. I would use a PNG formatted file due to it being lossless. Lossless is beneficial in this case because screenshots can be difficult to read, so the compression algorithm with other file types may cause a loss of quality and then become difficult to read.

1. The background color of an HTML element changes the color behind the content or text. Like using a blue sheet of paper to write on vs white or yellow. Foreground color changes the color of the text itself. If you have a small element ontop of a larger one, you can stack these. Take your black background sheet of paper and let's write on it. In order to write on it we have to put the text onto something and then put it on the paper. Let's write our text onto a label maker with black tape, or clear tape even! and set the label to print in Green... "Accessing mainframe... permission granted." Now let's take that and press it onto our black sheet of paper. Would ya look at that, we're hackers! Time to steal state secrets. Let's write another label that says "download file/state_secrets.jpeg.". Why? oh some nice man with a thick russian accent said he's pay for my mother's medical bills if I did it. uh oh! we're in for it now! I think that's an FBI helicopter outside already!

2. I'd make it very pink and girly. But with enough contrast between element colors that it meets the industry standard for accessibility and what not.

3. I would consider selecting fonts based on whether I want the user to have to download a new font or if they can use a built-in one. Also readability and style that matches the artistic vision of the website creator. Comic Sans is the best for almost everything so that's my go-to, but I think Papyrus is a good alternative. Hopefully website goers aren't dyslexic otherwise they're going to have one hell of a time.

4. `font-size` changes the size of the font, like you would in word or pages. It makes the default font size larger or smaller, `font-weight` changes the default thickness of the font from thin to bold. `font-style` changes the actual typeface, like Helvetica, or it's specific fonts, Helvetica Regular or Helvetica Italic

5. Two ways to change the spacing around characters is to use `letter-spacing` which spaces the individual characters apart from each other, looks super chic with tall, and thin typefaces.

## There's nothing else to know more about, I know literally everything

1. Just kidding, I'd like to know more about how to design my webpage and how I want it to look. Industry standards or basic templates I can follow.
