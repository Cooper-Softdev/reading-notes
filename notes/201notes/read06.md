### This section is important I assume because we're about to be going over DOM manipulation and using Objects. So I bet we'll be objects and having to manipulate the DOM with them to make something dynamic. Making buttons and adding text and all that jazz

## JavaScript Objects

1. Objects are like a pile of toys, each one is different from another. These differences can be a toy car, or a woody action figure. Woody has his pistol, vest and jeans as clothes and a hat. These are like properties of the object, there are many action figures, but not all have a silver revolver, cowboy hat, boots that say Andy. Some have space suits, with big glass helmets with wings and cannot fly. A toy car is another object, completely different from an action figure, but a literal object. Objects methods are like things that you can activate to do an action with the objects. Firing a laser out of your flight-less spaceman's wrist device, or pulling a talkbox string on the back of the cowboy.

2. They're easy to write if we're only making a few objects, instead of making a constructor and using new keyword. Which makes them easy to write and read if we're only making a few.

3. Objects are best used to store complex data structures and functions, as there is added functionality to manipulate these data at a later time and create new one based off it. It is also much easier to read the data and find what you're looking for instead of remembering the index number of the piece of data you want. Array's don't have methods to describe how one array differs from another array that also holds something like.. phone numbers. But arrays are very good at storing the same type of data on a large list for easy access.

4. If the properties are written as a variable then it would be easier to use bracket notation to get it's variable name and let the javascipt fill in the value when the value isn't known. If the properties are known like we are working with employee database and every employee has a "hireDate" then it's not necessary to use bracket and dot can be much easier.

5. this. refers to the object that the this method is contained within. Instead of writing out a long object name. The more objects we write the longer and more cumbersome it can be to write these things out. this. can autofill the object and then grab the property and fill that in.

## Introduction to the DOM

1. The DOM or Document Object Model is the interface for HTML documents. It holds all the information of the HTML document and allows it to be accessed and modified by the JS. Instead of making a change to our webpage and causing it to be reloaded, the browser makes a live view version of our HTML that can be edited in real time. I think.

2. DOM is modified by JavaScript so we are able to have dynamic webpages that do the cool things as we're interacting with it. This is very important for web apps that have a lot of data that would be inefficient to load multiple times.

### Things I want to know more about

1. Constructors... I kind of get it but I think I need to see it in a real life setting. I get what they are, and why they're useful. Maybe its when should they be used and when not, how many similar objects do we need before we should build a constructor.
