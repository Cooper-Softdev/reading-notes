# Reading Chart.js and Canvas

### This will make our final project way cool if we can find a way to use it.

## Canvas

  1. <canvas> allows you to assign a height and width to a viewport that will display 2d graphics.

  2. Canvas requires an opening and closing tag because it needs fallback content in-case the browser doesn't support the format.

  3. The getContext() method allows you to access the ability to render a 2d object. It gives you the tools to start drawing the 2d objects.
  
## Chart.js
  
  1. Chart.js is a charting tool for data visualization, it renders onto canvas from the previous questions.
  2. Some charts you can do with Chart.js are Scatter Charts, Bubble Charts, and Polar Area Charts.
  
  ## Animated Charts
  
  1. Charts are much easier to see data with and can allow for a greater understanding of what the data the chart is tryign to convey.
  2. Chart.js can aid in the previous application by making a chart showing the most liked product vs some of the least liked products without having to read each line individually.
