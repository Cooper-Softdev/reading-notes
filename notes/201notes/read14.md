# Reading Labb 14 CSS

### Spicing up the CSS with transitions, animations, and such help make your site look more complete and professional, if kept to a reasonable amount.

## CSS Transforms

1. CSS transform allows a user to Scale an element up or down, Rotate an element around in a circle, or Skew the element like a Star Wars beginning scroll. Or combine any of those and more to make more complex or nicer CSS styling.
2. One of the most common transforms is the hover, when you hover over an element with your cursor you can cause the element to perform an action. Like enlarging a button and changing its color when you hover.

## CSS Transitions & Animations

1. Transition lets the developer to animate a change to an element in a specific manner. You can control the speed that a sidebar menu opens so it doesn't happen immediately which may be jarring to the user, or to make something seem like it's loading and then taking off with a slow and then fast transition. This changes between 2 states, so your starting condition and ending condition of the element.
2. CSS animation differs in that while you can do similar things, it adds the functionality of changing not just between state 1 and state 2, but adding in additional states called `Keyframes` So you can change to multiple colors of a background while you scroll, as an example. This is the largest differentiator between transition and animation.

## Example CSS transitions and their benefits

1. Transitions are engaging for users and increase site enjoyment which is said to help increase conversions. Turning a simple person viewing the site into user/member or into a customer.
2. CSS Animations and Transitions help the website aesthetic appeal and increases interactivity when the website feels responsive and does what the user expects it to do in a pleasing manner. It also aids in making websites more differentiated from competitors so an easier to use website that's more visually appealing should help sway a potential customer into choosing whatever it is that website is promoting. Either making a nice website for a realtor that seems professional and like they care, or an easy to use website to make it easy to purchase.
