### Learning flexbox is probably a good idea for displaying the tables and what's around it. Especially if we're going to be adding more and more.

## Flexbox

1. Flexbox being 1 dimensional means it controls the item in 1 dimension, either vertical or horizontal to the assigned axis. This is unlike grid that controls both axisees, axi? axen? it fo x and y, same time.
2. The main axis is the flex-direction you assign to the element. Horizontal or Vertical, and the cross axis is the one that crosses your main perpendicular.
3. In Flexbox you can reverse columns and rows, but since CSS is visual and not HTML semantic, it won't change the Semantic meaning or order of what you've just changed. So a screen reader may say one thing, but do another. This is considered, bad.

## CSS and _YOU_

1. Flexbox advantages over float, vertically centering a block of content inside its parent. big one. Making children inside a container take up an equal amount of the available height/width regardless of their own size. and making all columns in a multi-column layout be the same height regardless of content size. So the vertical version of the width thing, I guess.
2. Not sure if it does, except I really hate bad UI, so I may end up doing a lot of this just because I may feel that I could do it better. But so far I really hate CSS.
