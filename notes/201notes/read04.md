# Reading 04 HTML Links, JS Functions, and CSS layout

#### These are important because soon we'll be taking our functions and arrays and placing themwithin our html documents and they're probably really ugly by default.

## HTML Hyperlinks

1. We put the content inside of an `<a>` element which means anchor.
2. the `href` attribute contains the actual link. The actual https://bigmoney.com text.
3. Ensuring links are accessible to all readers is accomplished but putting in a text string for the link within the anchor element. This allows screen readers to read the human written text describing what the link is, since links can be long and convoluted.

## CSS Layout, Normal Flow and Positioning

1. "normal flow" is the default behavior of CSS styling. It arranges the elements on the page even when no styling is added to the text isn't one giant paragraph. Block-level elements create a brand new line when they're declared in HTML, things like `<div> <p> and <h1>` for example.
2. Block-level elements create new lines therefore stacking vertically, and inline elements are contained within the line they are written without creating a new line, but will text-wrap. <br> IS NOT a block-level element.
3. Static positioning is the default for every html element.
4. Absolute positioning allows you to position an element with much more precision than the normal flow would allow.
5. Fixed positions is fixed relative to the viewport/browser window. Absolute it relative to it's nearest ancestor that has a position value other than `static`.

## JavaScript - Reusable Blocks of Code

1. Function declaration is to create the function and maybe create a value or text for it, and invoking a function is to "call" the function, which means you're telling the function to do the thing it's supposed to do, and give me the output value.
2. A parameter is a variable that is listed within the function's declaration. it's a placeholder or container for values that will be passed into the function when it's invoked. An argument is the actual value that is passed into the function that fills the parameter container with a value for the function to use.

## Miscellaneous

1. Pair programming would be a great help for me, hopefully it would help me with the Engaged collaboration to help stay focused. As well as getting used to some actual work environments for the companies that actually use pair programming which I hear is a lot more popular.

## Things I want to know more about

+ CSS is a magic mystery box, I need more practice with it. Also, arrays are a bit confusing but I think I just need to solidify it's shape in my head so I can wrap my head around it.
