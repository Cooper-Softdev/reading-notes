## Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API (Watch a Twitch streamer code an Express API in 20 minutes!)

1. Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?
  - The relationship between REST and CRUD is that REST is an architectural style that provides guidelines and principles for designing networked applications, including APIs, and CRUD represents the basic operations performed on data within the APIs.


2. If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?
  - Define resources and representations, like JSON and XML.
  - Determine endpoints (the URL structure).
  - Choose HTTP Methods, like CRUD.
  - Implement the API logic, like the server code to handle requests and responses and errors with clients and databases.
  - Test and Document, comment out an API request with examples of how new requests should be formatted.
