# Introduction to React and Components

## Component-Based Architecture

1. A component in react is a part of the react code that does rendering for parts of the UI. In an effort to promote reusability of pieces of code.
2. Components are Reusable, Replaceable, and Independent.
3. The same thing I just answered twice I think! Components architecture is reusable and modular, and can be easily adapted to fit different use cases which allows the developer to write faster and make things easier to read and maintain. This also promotes scalability when things can be expanded or easily replaced without breaking large parts of the codebase. and MUCH MORE!

## Props and how to use them

1. Props is short for Properties.
2. Props are used for passing data from component parents down the hierarchy to child components.
3. Props flow from the parent element down to the child elements and are read-only.
