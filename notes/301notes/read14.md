## Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
  - During that time, personal computers started to increase in number across the U.S.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
  - It matters because it creates the perception to professors or industry professionals that playing on, or using computers growing up meant that males had a greater familiarity with computers. As computers were marketed towards men and boys more it started a narrative that tech was for men only. So if women did not have a computer growing up, which is likely due to marketing, they did not gain familiarity, and even if they did professors were not likely to assume that due to them being women.

## Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?
  - When they are driven by company leaders who know and understand the benefits of diversity.

3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
