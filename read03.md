# Reflection and Discussion

**Git** is a type of technology called *version control software*. There is more than one type of VCS like Mercurial or SVN, but they all
operate on the same principle of tracking changes made to documents, files, and directories with a *repository*. The ability to track changes allows
programmers to roll-back to a previous version of their repository, or to make multiple versions of the same documents for different use-cases.

**GitHub** is a microsoft owned and open source cloud-based repository and graphic user interface for Git. This allows a single user to access their repository remotely without setting up their own home network.
