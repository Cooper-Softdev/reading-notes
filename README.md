## What is a growth mindset to me?

I believe a *growth mindset* is the belief that one's *skills can be developed*, regardless of time it takes to achieve the goal, and not that talents or skills are innate gifts. When I was at the academy for air traffic control, the psychologists were very clear that the data shows that regardless of how long it takes someone to learn a skill, the end competency is the same as someone who learned it faster. Knowing this really helps persist through the obstacles and difficulties in training.

## Things to help stay in growth mindset -- Identify Triggers

  - Try not to allow yourself to divert attention when encountering an obstacle. Don't allow your mistakes to snowball into a disaster.
  - Try not to allow criticism to hinder your efforts into self-doubt, or become defensive.
  - Try not to let someone elses success hinder your own. We all learn at a different pace, but the end results are statistically the same.
