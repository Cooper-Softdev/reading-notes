# What is a growth mindset to me?

I think a #growth mindset# is the belief that one's skills can be developed, regardless of time it takes to achieve the goal, and not that talents or skills are innate gifts. When I was at the academy for air traffic control, the psychologists were very clear that the data shows that regardless of how long it takes someone to learn a skill, the end competency is the same as someone who learned it faster. Knowing this really helps persist through the obstacles and difficulties in training.
